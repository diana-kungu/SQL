--Scenario/Goal
 /*The challenge focuses on Whyte's Cafe based in Stevenage in the UK. 
 The cafe has been growing well and brings in a good amount of revenue but 
 like any business, they are trying to drive for more. Many popular lunch 
 shops provide a 'Meal Deal' when you can purchase a drink, a snack to go 
 with a main for a set price. Whyte's Cafe wants to know how much it would cost
 them to install a Meal Deal (for Â£5 each meal - what a bargain!) option on
  their menu as the ownership team believe it will entice a lot more customers 
  through the door.*/
